</H2></CENTER>   
<P>THIS MATERIAL IS ONLY FOR REFERENCE SINCE THE SSC IS NO LONGER PRODUCED.</P>
<P>This is the only commercially available GameBoy programmable cartridge that
I know of. It contains 4 MegaBits of storage capacity and has software to store
up to 4 different programs in this storage space.</P>
<P>I unit I purchased was made by China Coach Limited. When it originally
arrived, it came with out a power supply and software. There were two pieces. A
base unit that connects to a PC parallel port, and the programmable cartridge
that actually is used with the GameBoy. There was also a message that they were
out of software diskettes and they would email me the software. </P>
<P>When I finally received the software several hours later, the first thing I
noticed was that the software said, 'Printer Port Error!' I wasn't sure if this
was because I had a 100MHz Pentium or not.  I tried the unit on every x86 Intel
chip about ever made so I was further confused. On a brighter note, I could tell
by looking at the software that a tremendous amount of time and effort was put
into it so I was pretty darn sure that this was not a 'bogus' product, but that
something <I>simple</I> was probably the source of my problems.</P>
<P>I was talking to someone that told me that early versions of the software
are very <I>timing sensitive</I> and that he had a
<A HREF="ssc.zip">later version</A> of one of the pieces of software if I
wanted it. I immediately requested this and he sent it pronto. This seems to
have cured the problem of reading the Smart Card so I feel much better already.
<STRONG>Please note that when reading 'snapshots' from your computer that they
<I>MUST</I> be in the form of 'GB*.GB' (For example 'gbtetris.gb'.) You will
get a 'File Format error!' if you don't.</STRONG> I now have what I believe to
be the  <A HREF="smart2.zip">latest version</A> that I have modified to only
display files in the format 'GB*.GB' since that is the only format the software
recognizes.</P>
