;* Switching CPU speeds on the GBC
;*  written for RGBASM
;*

;  This is the code needed to switch the GBC
; speed from single to double speed or from
; double speed to single speed.
;
; Note: The 'nop' below is ONLY required if
; you are using RGBASM version 1.10c or earlier
; and older versions of the GBDK assembly
; language compiler. If you are not sure if
; you need it or not then leave it in.
;
;  The real opcodes for 'stop' are $10,$00.
; Some older assemblers just compiled 'stop'
; to $10 hence the need for the extra byte $00.
; The opcode for 'nop' is $00 so no harm is
; done if an extra 'nop' is included
