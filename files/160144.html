<B>Basic 160x144 image loading.</B><BR>
----------------------------
<P>
First, convert your image using PCX2GB (prefered) to GBDK output format using
this on the command line 
<P>
<SAMP>pcx2gb n d filename.pcx filename.c</SAMP>
<P>
(I'll be using PCX2GB for this description, there are other utils you can
use for this). Next, in the output file, change the name of the unsigned
char to whatever you'd like. Then, in your project's main source file, put
<P>
<SAMP>#include &lt;drawing.h&gt;</SAMP>
<P>
Now, you'll put this whereever you want your image to appear: 
<P>
<SAMP>draw_image(unsigned char's name);</SAMP>
<P>
You should get a nice, full screen image.<BR>
I used this in my South Park X-Treme demo and it worked fine. There were
some drawbacks to doing it this way, though (cart size was 128k, had to use
bank switching to hold the images).

------------------------------------------
<P>
There is a better way if you plan on using a different sized image. Convert
the image in PCX2GB using 
<P>
<SAMP>pcx2gb o d filename.pcx filename.c filename.map</SAMP>
<P>
This will not only optimize your image so it'll be smaller in code, it'll
also decrease the need for a larger cart size. (Thanx go out to Icehawk for
making the beginners docs to explain some of these things -
<A HREF="http://www.gbdev.org/news/">www.gbdev.org/news/</A>). 
<P>
What you need to do is include both your converted image (filename.c) and
your tile map (filename.map) into your project. You will then put the following
code into your project whereever you want your image to appear:
<P>
<SAMP>/* Beginning of code snippet <BR>
The following can be changed:<BR>
bgpal = the color palette being used<BR>
MK = image tile data being used<BR>
MKCGBMap = map of how your palettes will be displayed<BR>
MKMap = map of how your tiles will be displayed */</SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>// Set palette(s) for
image</SAMP><BR>
<SAMP>set_bkg_palette(0,2,&amp;bgpal[0]);</SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>// Set bkg tile data<BR>
set_bkg_data(0,255,MK); </SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>// Switch to VRAM<BR>
VBK_REG = 1; </SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>// Set the map for where your palettes will be
displayed<BR>
set_bkg_tiles(0,0,20,18,MKCGBMap); </SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP> // Switch out of VRAM<BR>
VBK_REG = 0;</SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>// Set the map for where the bkg tiles will be
displayed<BR>
set_bkg_tiles(0,0,20,18,MKMap);</SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>// Show the background<BR>
SHOW_BKG;</SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>// Turn the display on</SAMP><BR>
<SAMP>DISPLAY_ON; </SAMP>
<P>
That should help. If you have any more questions,
