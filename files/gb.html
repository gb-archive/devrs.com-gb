<H1>Gameboy cartridges </H1> 
<P>Here is how the Gameboy cartridges look like internally (two different types
 of cartridges):</P>

<H1>Gameboy MBCs </H1> 
<P>Memory bank controllers (MBCs) allow to switch banks and control back-up 
RAM.</P> 
<P>
 MBCs contain registers (5 bits for MBC1, 4 bits for MBC2) in which you load the
 value  of a memory bank before accessing it.</P> 
<P>
 MBC1 can control up to 4 Mbits (32 banks * 128 kbits) together with RAM. Games 
which  need more RAM that the limited internal RAM use MBC1. External RAM is 
generally backed-up  with a battery.</P> 
<P>
 MBC2 has 512 * 4 bit of internal memory used as back-up memory. It is accessed 
using  A8..A0 and D3..D0.</P> 
<P>
 MBC1 is controlled by the A15..A13 address lines, MBC2 by A15,A14,A8. Banks are
 written  in D0..D4 (D0..D3 for MBC2). When controlling both RAM and ROM, ROM is
 selected when  A15 is low (addresses 0x0000 to 0x7FFF).</P> 
<P>
 The back-up memory is preserved by a 3V lithium battery together with a NV-RAM 
controller.</P> 
<P>
 The ~MREQ line is low each time the processor makes a memory access (e.g. with 
the  LD operation), but not when it fetches instructions.</P> 
<P>
 Here are the different operations which can be performed with MBCs.</P>
