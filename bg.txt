
 Getting a video games programming job often always
requires experience of some kind in game development.
This can be difficult due to the fact that on many
game consoles you can't get experience until you have
a games programming job.

 What to do then? Learning game development on the
PC platform is one wey to break into games developmnent.
This is a "open system" so this is possible.

 To get any games job usually requires that you submit
samples of your work. Often this even means submitting
a game that is nearly complete in order that the potential
employer might better realize your potential for code,
graphics, & sound. Your chances are slim to none of getting
a job without some kind of example of your work. An
extremely comprehensive example is best as is shows
that you have the motivation to start a project and
see it through to completion.

 The majority of game companies already have game ideas
and they are looking for someone dependable & reliable 
to develop these games into finished products. It is rare
to find a company that will heavily consider anything
that is your original creation. It does happen but the
odds are not very good. Just keep in mind that whatever
you develop might not be published but it could be used
to launch you into a games development career if potential
can be seen in your work.
